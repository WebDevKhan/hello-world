My First GitHub Repository

Hi All,

This is Muhammed Mazhar Khan, an aspiring and knowledge hungry Web Developer, who at the beginning was very afraid of Coding and hated it every bit, but after realising the awesomeness of programming and how it can be a tool to accomplish tasks of minor to major size and help ease our life, I've dedicated myself towards learning to Code and building meaningful things with the Awesome Code :)
